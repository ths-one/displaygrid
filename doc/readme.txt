--------------------

Desciption:

Diplaygrid javascript/html framework to display a
variable sized grid which elements can be freely 
defined by special functions.

Synopsis:
displaygrid.html?width=w+height=h+cellwidth=cw+cellheight=ch

Parameters:
  width      :  grid witdth in cells.
  height     : grid height in cells
  cellwidth  : cell width in pixels
  cellheight : cell heigth in pixels

Requirements:
Displaygrid requires a decent browser supporting javascript and html5 canvas.

Testing/Diagnostics:
Displaygrid should display a grid using the defined dimensions (see
Parameters) and fill it with random colors. Input Parameters are
checked for positive integers but not for upper limits (so come on,
check it out and have your browser take a 4k grid using a 1 pixel cell).

Tested on Firefox 60+. No browwser capability checks are done, if it 
doesn't work for you , use another browser.
